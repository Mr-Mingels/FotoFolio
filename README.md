### [FotoFolio](https://foto-folio.vercel.app/)

## Project Introduction:

FotoFolio is a powerful and visually engaging full-stack photo gallery application, carefully designed and developed as a showcase piece for my portfolio. 

With FotoFolio, users can effortlessly navigate through an expansive database of high-quality images sourced from the Pixabay API. The application offers a rich suite of features such as the ability to search for specific images, download high-resolution photos directly, and 'like' favorite images for future viewing. This personalized 'liked images' collection persists across sessions using local storage, creating a tailored user experience.

The application was built keeping in mind the needs and desires of a modern-day user. It provides an infinite scroll experience for seamless browsing, and detailed views of each image with a simple click. Notably, it also features an asynchronous image loading system with clear loading statuses to enhance the user experience. The gallery layout is responsive, optimizing its display based on user screen size, ensuring a consistent and pleasant browsing experience on any device.
